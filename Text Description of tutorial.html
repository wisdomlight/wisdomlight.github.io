    <h1>Installing Tridactyl</h1>
    <p>Once Tridactyl is installed you should notice two things.
    <ol>
      <li>Look at the bottom right corner of this webpage, can you see where it says <span style="font-family: monospace;">normal</span></li>
      <li>if you open a new tab in your Firefox you will see that the shortcuts are not there. This is due to some limitations that we're working to resolve with the team at Firefox</li>
    </ol></p>
    <p>Of the above two - the really important one is this little word <span class="mode">normal</span>.</p>
    <p>This word shows you in which mode you are.</p>
    <p>Many times in the future your actual problem will be because you do not know in which mode you are! So, again, Know your modes!
    </p>There are number of modes to choose from but for know we'll be focusing on only three. <span class="mode">normal</span><span class="mode">hint</span><span class="mode">ex commands</span>
    <p>Here's another thing to try: press once the letter f. The page will change its appearance (nothing to worry about), and besides the change in color and the addition of red squares with letters, you will see at the bottom right corner where previouly it said <span style="font-family: monospace;">normal</span>, now it says <span style="font-family: monospace">hint</span></p>
    <p>You now discoverd really the best thing about Tridactyl, you can move from normal mode to hint mode - and in hint mode you can select elements without moving your fingers from the keyboard. And this is one of the most amazing things you have discovered in your entire life!!! Even if you don't know it....;-)</p>
