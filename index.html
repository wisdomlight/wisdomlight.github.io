        <h1>Tridactyl A Beginners Tutorial</h1>
        <p>Welcome to this beginners tutorial. If you are familiar with vim you'd probably prefer a more professional tutorial <a href="https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl#highlighted-features">here</a>.</p>
        <p>As the title suggests this tutorial is a practical introduction for people who are not Vim experienced. This tutorial aims at helping you understand things and it is a little bit verbose - it uses a lot of words; which you may find annoying. But this is in order to explain as clearly as possible what this is all about</p>
        <p>We will explain basic concepts, and we will give you opportunity to try it out for your self.</p>
        
        <br>
