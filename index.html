        <h1>Tridactyl A Beginners Tutorial</h1>
        <p>Welcome to this beginners tutorial. If you are familiar with vim you'd probably prefer a more 'cut to the chase' tutorial, plesa go <a href="https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl#highlighted-features">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Because this tutorial is aimed at people who are not experinced with Vim, you'll need to be patient and try mastering each bit at a time; we'll take a bit more verbose approach(meaning we'll be chatty...) but a TL;DR version is also provided.
        <p>We will explain basic concepts, and we will give you opportunity to try it out for your self.</p>

        <br>
        <p>If you are familiar with Vim concepts you may find all you need <a href="moz-extension://c19b3abd-17a8-4675-a6b6-151edce7f126/static/clippy/1-tutor.html">here</a>.</p>
